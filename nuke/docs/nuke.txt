NUKE HQueue rendering.

Installation notes:

	Client side:

	LINUX:
		1. Append Nuke installation folder to HQueue client user environment variable PATH. For example if your HQueue client installation uses user named "hquser" and your Nuke
		installation folder is /opt/Nuke6.2v1 then your should append it to PATH variable in .bashrc file locaten in hquser home directory. Like this:
			export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/Nuke6.2v1

		2. During rendering process Nuke uses local temporary storage /tmp/nuke. By default	this path is owned by root, so we need to grant access for hquser so it can
		write to this folder. It's possible to be done by executing following command: 
			sudo chmod -R 777 /tmp/nuke/
			
		3. Copy or symlink all of the files inside cgftools/nuke folder into /home/your_user/.nuke/ folder. Please note that on render nodes "your_user" is HQueue user, in
		our case it's "hquser"


	Server side:
		Needed packages:
			python-mysqldb
	
		1. It's allways a good idea to use MySQL instead of SQLite, so you need to change sqlalchemy.default.url variable in your hqserver.ini to this:
			sqlalchemy.default.url = mysql://username:password@host:port/database
		Also uncomment these two lines:	
			sqlalchemy.default.pool_size = 30
			sqlalchemy.default.max_overflow = 20
